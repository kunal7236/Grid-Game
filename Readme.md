# Word Matching Game

A simple, beautiful, interactive word-matching game for children. This small web project demonstrates a lightweight, fast-loading single-page game built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

## Project structure

- `index.html` — the game's HTML entry point.
- `style.css` — styles and responsive layout for the game UI.
- `script.js` — game logic, event handling, and simple state management.

## How to run

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use the browser's File > Open). This works for quick local testing.
